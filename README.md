# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Answer:
Software development is the process of designing developing teasting and maintaining softwares

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Answer:
Software engineering involves a collaborative appraoch to implementing software solutions. It takes a more comprehensive approach to problem solving where the user is at the center of the development process. There are clearly defined roles in this method of development where as traditional programming focuses on writing code to solve specific problems which is not collaborative.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Answers:
1. Brainstoming: This stage involves setting the goals and business requirements

2. Analyze rwquirements: this involves understanding the needs of the users 

3. Design phase involves prototyping and and coming out with solutions based on users needs.

4. Implementation involves coding out the proposed solutions or prototypes 

5. Testing involves verifying the performance of the software based on standards

6. and deployment involves making the product available for use online 

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Answers:
Agile teams teams work in a collaborative way usually involving sprints managing their own work and how to accomplish it whilst The waterfall model is more structured, hierachical and process driven. 
The agile team is more equiped to adapt to changing business requirements whilst the waterfall model may strugglel to adapt to changing requirements.
Agile teams are preferred in development where the final product is not defined bbecause it allows for iterations and flexibility but when strict business requirements needs to be met, waterfall model is preferred

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Answer:
Requirement engineering involves knowing the specifications of developing a product preserving the specifications
it involves undersatnding stakeholders needs, specifying the requirements, validation of the requirements, and appropriately managing changes to the requirements.
Requirement engineering ensures that the the product is in line with stakeholder expectations, it mitigates the rists and promotes cost efficiency.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Answer:
Software modularity involves dividing a software system into smaller independent components that work to perform a specific function.
modularity promotes clarity, flexibility, and ease of management. By breaking down complex systems into smaller, cohesive modules, software engineers create robust, maintainable, and scalable solutions

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
Answer:
1. Unit testing verifies the functioning of individual components of the software
2. Integration testing veries the intreaction among various components of the software
3. System seting evaluates the entire software produced to validate performance and usability
4. Acceptance testing ensures that the software meets the user requirements
Testing is a quality control method that allows for more efficient softwares to be produced, it ensures that user needs are met and that standard ore adhered to.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Answer:
Version control systems are used to track changes in code during development. It allows for colaboration as well as a back up system when writing code
Git is a popular version control 

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
Answer:
The project manager cordinates the process of developing a software. He assigns roles and ensures that stakeholder and user needs are met.
The project manager leads the team in agile frameworks, plans the project and assign roles to complete the project, makes sure stakeholder needs are met and manges and allocates resources.
The challenges of project management includes changing business requirements which can disrupt the project schedules, time constraint and unclear expectations

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Answer:
Software maintenace are sytems and processes that keeps a software working correctly efficiently and effectively and securely and ensuring it ,meets the users needs.
Maintenance ensures that a software is functioning effectively after deployment.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Answer:
1. Privacy and data protection. this is overcome by seeking an informed consent
2. Conflict of interest. By disclod=sing conflicts the concern can be overcome
3. 

Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers
